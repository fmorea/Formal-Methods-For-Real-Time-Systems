# Formal Methods For Real Time Systems
## Formal Digital Twin of a Lego Mindstorms Production Plant

 The aim of this project was to create a formal description of a digital twin for a LEGO model of a conveyor belt using the UPPAAL programming language, an academic tool. The specification, provided in PDF format, outlines the entities that needed to be modeled. Additionally, a presentation summarizing the specification is available for easier comprehension.

 To review my solution to the problem, please refer to the "Report_Homework.pdf" file. The accompanying XML file is intended for importing into the UPPAAL tool, allowing you to test and evaluate the solution.
